# Small_Business_Website
Building a small business website that I learnt during Laravel Lab on E-commerce course. 

This is a Restaurant Business Website. The name of the restaurant is Mama's Kitchen.

On the first page of the website we have a image slider to showcase latest food items and offers. The slider is completely dynamic i.e. the admin can post photos from the admin panel of the backend.
It looks like the screenshot below:

Then comes the second page of the website: The **Price Tab**
When the user clicks here, the page is navigated to the prices of the foods and dishes avaiable in the restaurant.
Please look at the following screenshot:
