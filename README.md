# Small_Business_Website
Building a small business website that I learnt during Laravel Lab on E-commerce course. 

This is a Restaurant Business Website. The name of the restaurant is Mama's Kitchen.

On the first page of the website we have a image slider to showcase latest food items and offers. The slider is completely dynamic i.e. the admin can post photos from the admin panel of the backend.
