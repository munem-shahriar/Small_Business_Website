# Small_Business_Website
Building a small business website that I learnt during Laravel Lab on E-commerce course. 

This is a Restaurant Business Website. The name of the restaurant is Mama's Kitchen.

On the first page of the website we have a image slider to showcase latest food items and offers. The slider is completely dynamic i.e. the admin can post photos from the admin panel of the backend.
It looks like the screenshot below:

Then comes the second page of the website: The **Price Tab**
When the user clicks here, the page is navigated to the prices of the foods and dishes avaiable in the restaurant.
Please look at the following screenshot:

There is a reservation option available in the **Reservation Tab** where the customer can request for reservation of the restaurant. The request will be verified and accepted/rejected by an admin in the backend of the website.
It looks like the following screenshot:

There is also a **Contact US** tab available for the customer in case of further communication. Screenshot is given below:

## The Backend
______________________________________________________________________

I used creative tim's material design theme in the backend to make it look nice and clean. All the functionalities in the frontend can be dynamically changed and updated from the backend. The website admin controls these changes.

This is how the **Dashboard** looks like:

This is the **Categories of food items**:

This is a screenshot of **Food items** from the admin view:
